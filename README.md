# A simple remake of the GNU Coreutils to try and learn Rust for CLI development

My first foray into officially learning rust by attempting to create a project with only the knowledge I have gained from reading **The Book**. I hope to be able to implement at least half of the coreutils before I stop working on this project. 
This project is more or less just to get a better understanding of the Rust language before I move onto a more complex project that I have in mind.
